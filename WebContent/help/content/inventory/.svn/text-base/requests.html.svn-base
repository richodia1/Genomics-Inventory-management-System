<h1>Germplasm Request management</h1>
<p>Inventory system allows for managing incoming requests for germplasm distribution, including SMTA generation. Any incoming request for germplasm (via
phone, email, visit) should be captured using the Inventory system. This allows for easy reporting to Governing Body and ensures requests are properly handled.</p>

<h2>Requested items</h2>
<p>Requested items can be registered with the request by entering item names (accession names) of requested germplasm into the provided field.</p>
<p class="help-img"><img src="img/request-additems.png" />Registering requested items</p>
<p id="request/order_accessionNames">Enter item names, separated by [space] or [newline] character and press <b>Add items</b> button.</p>

<div id="lot-selection">
<h2>Lot selection</h2>
<p>A requested item (accession) will usually have more than one available lot. Before germplasm can be distributed to Requester, source lots for distribution
must be selected. To assign lots to requested items, click <b>Assign lots</b> button.</p>
<p>For every item requested, list of all lots with quantity &gt; zero are displayed. Select the lot that you wish to be used in distribution and type in the
quantity to be distributed. In case that requested item does not exist in Inventory system or quantity is available, you will not be able to assign a lot. The
requested item will remain pending until later time, when a lot is available.</p>

<p class="help-img"><img src="img/request-assign.png" />Assigning lots to requested items</p>
</div>

<h2>Germplasm distribution</h2>
<p>Once lots have been assigned to requested items, <b>Inventory Updates</b> can be created and they will be linked to the particular request.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You can have more than one Inventory update per individual germplasm request.</p>
<p>Clicking <b>Create distribution</b> will generate a new Inventory update if there are any <em>pending</em> items to be distributed. The Inventory update
record will display a list of all <em>pending</em> items under the .</p>
<p class="help-img"><img src="img/request-dist.png" />Germplasm distribution based on request</p>
<p>It is because Inventory update record is linked to a germplasm request, a list of <b>selected lots</b> can be displayed before any lots are scanned in.
These are clearly marked as <b>PENDING</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Appropriate lots must be collected from storage and scanned into the distribution.</p>
<p>Committing the inventory update to the system will mark matching requested lots as <b>DISPATCHED</b>. When all requested items have been marked as
dispatched, no further inventory updates are required and the germplasm request is considered CLOSED.</p>

<h2>Reporting to Governing Body</h2>
<p>Using query service one can query for required details of reporting on germplasm distribution. Some additional columns may have to be added after report
is generated by Inventory System.</p>
