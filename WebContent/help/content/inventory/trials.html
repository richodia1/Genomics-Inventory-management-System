<h1>Trials and Traits</h1>
<p>Managing Inventory data using Excel files introduces several problems especially when dealing with repeated measures and other related data. In Excel,
this can either be resolved by adding columns to spreadsheet (e.g. Viability1, Viability2, Viability3) or using additional spreadsheets where that information
can be stored in long format (e.g. Lot ID, Date, Viability).</p>

<p>The introduction of Trials to Genebank Inventory system provides a facility to manage, store and retrieve such data measured.</p>


<h2>Trials or Experiments</h2>
<p>Managing germplasm requires measurement of germplasm properties (traits). Example traits: Germination rate, Viability, Moisture content, Virus indexing,
etc. Measuring those properties is usually done in bulk where several lots are observed for same set of traits.</p>
<p>We define a Trial as a list of lots being observed and which properties are measured.</p>

<h3>Viability testing</h3>
<p>Seeds in Long term storage have their viability tested at several year intervals. This allows curator to establish the trends of viability within a
particular crop and provides valuable insight in how viability decreases over time. To analyze these trends, all viability testing results must be available to
curator. The Inventory system now provides means to hold such data.</p>
<p>Viability is usually measured in the same experiment as Germination rate (6 days after planting).</p>


<h2>Trait sets</h2>
<p>Trait sets in the system allow genebank managers to “group” individual traits into commonly used sets which are observed in the same Trial. From example
above, Viability testing requires observation of two traits: Germination6d and final Viability.</p>


<h2>Traits</h2>
<p>A trait defines observation and measurement method used to capture germplasm properties. Observing the same property but with different measurement
method calls for new trait.</p>

<h3>Trait conversion</h3>
<p>Different traits measuring the same property can sometimes be converted or merged into one. Measuring 100 seed weight in milligram instead of gram allows
for conversion between units as long as the method of observation is exactly the same.</p>


<h2>Trials in Inventory system</h2>
<p>Using Inventory system to capture trial data follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Establish traits</li>
	<li>Create trait set</li>
	<li>Create Trial and select trait set</li>
	<li>Select the lots that should be observed in the Trial</li>
	<li>Enter captured data</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 1 and 2 above are system “configuration” steps, while steps 3-5 are daily use steps.</p>
<h3>Configuring Trials system</h3>
<p>To convert existing practices to Traits system, managers should review existing practices in reverse order:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Review data and data types captured in previous trials</li>
	<li>Review and document lot selection process</li>
	<li>Identify trial properties (date, naming)</li>
	<li>Identify set of traits observed in trial</li>
	<li>Identify and document individual traits</li>
</ol>
<h4>Establishing traits</h4>
<p>An individual Trait captures the following information: Trait name, Unique short name (XLS variable name), Method of observation and measurement, Data
type and scale.</p>


<h4>Coded traits</h4>
<p>Observed data is usually captured in numeric form (100%, 44%, 1.3g, etc). Using coding information, one can define a fixed set of values that can be used
as trait values. Measuring susceptibility to virus is usually captured in “text” form: Positive +++, Positive ++, Positive +, Marginal +/-, Negative -.</p>
<p>The Traits system allows to store these as “Coded” traits where unique values are assigned to all coded values: 3 for Positive +++, 0 for Marignal, -1
for Negative.</p>
<p class="help-img"><img src="img/trial-traitcoded.png" />Example coded trait</p>
<p>Using coded traits limits what data can be entered as observation results.</p>


<h4>Creating trait sets</h4>
<p>In a single Trial several different traits may be observed. To simplify Trial configuration, you can register Trait sets that are commonly used. A trait
set “Viability testing” with Germination6d and final Viability is an example of trait set.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>, there is no limit on which traits are measured in a single Trial.</p>



<h1>Using Trials system</h1>
<p>Trials system captures data which lots are being tested, when the trial started, trial title and description and most importantly, which Traits are
observed.</p>

<h2>Creating Trials</h2>
<p>Clicking “Create new trial” on dashboard opens Trial properties form:</p>
<p class="help-img"><img src="img/trial-edit.png" />Trial properties</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Trial name:</b> give meaningful name to trial</li>
	<li><b>Date of trial</b></li>
	<li><b>Trait group:</b> select group of traits that are observed in the trial.</li>
	<li><b>Description:</b> additional description of trial.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once trial is record is created, register lots with the trial. This records that a particular lot should be included in trial and has to be included in
observation.</p>


<h3>Selecting lots</h3>
<p>Registering lots to be observed in a trial is done by entering Lot ID numbers or Lot barcode numbers (using barcode reader).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Trials can also quickly be created for any committed Inventory update record (e.g. Regeneration) by clicking the “Create trial” button. This
will register all lots in the update for trial.</p>


<h3>Data capture</h3>
<p>Observation results are either entered in Excel file and uploaded to the system or the on-line form is used to update data. Once data is entered:</p>
<p class="help-img"><img src="img/trial-results.png" />Trial results</p>

<p>Observed data is also displayed on lot profile page in “Last trial results” section:</p>
